# Speakski
Learn your first 300 Polish words.

## The idea
I've got many English friends who at some point expressed their will of learning Polish.
However, as that language has plenty different forms, pre- and sufixes, genders etc, it was very difficult task.

To be able to comunincate in English on most basic level, you only need some 300-400 words. I decided to give a try to that approach.
This app <b> will not <b> teach you to speak like the native in 3 weeks. To be fair, it won't etach you to sound like a native at all.

Speakski will allow you to learn most useful wirds in their most useful form. 
After all, if you say "yesterday me driking beer" or "tomorrow we going holiday" you still pass the message. 
Poor form does not affect the meaning as much as one could expect.
If your relatives don't speak any English at all, they will apreciate you trying.
Also, for some reason Poles find it "cute" when foreigners try to speak their language.

Of course when speaking very incorrectly, you may expect them to try to correct you. Please don't take it as them being rude. 
It's commonly accepted in Polish culture to correct other's semantical errors. 
I'm not going to dive in historical reasons behind that phenomenon. Enough to say that without that approach, Polish language could not survive nearly 200 years of foreign occupation.

Anyway, if your intention in a long run is to learn Polish properly, pay attention to their explaination.
If you found very basic form (some could say incorrect) of the language satysfing, then feel free to ignore it.
Generaly Poles like to think that their language is the most difficult of all, so you can use that argument to shut them up. :)
